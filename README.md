### Framework Overview

This framework is designed to manage various aspects of a Unity project through a modular, organized structure. It provides comprehensive systems for game functionalities such as abilities, data management, events, localization, networking, and more. Each module is encapsulated for maintainability, performance, and scalability.

#### **Modules**

1. **Main**  
    The main manager that oversees the entire game system. Provides access to core functionalities like the Object Pool, Observer, Event System, and more.

2. **Data**  
   Handles persistent data storage and retrieval. Supports player preferences, game saves, and general data management.

3. **DesignPattern**  
   Implements commonly used design patterns like Singleton, Object Pooling, Dependency Injection, and State Machines to organize and streamline game code.

4. **Entity**  
   Manages game entities such as characters, NPCs, enemies, and other in-game objects. Entities are represented in a dynamic, reusable way.

5. **EventManager**  
   A centralized system for handling game events using an Observer pattern. This allows for loosely coupled communication between different game components.

6. **GameConfigs**  
   Stores configuration settings and gameplay-related parameters. Use ScriptableObjects to manage and tweak game variables without hardcoding them in scripts.

7. **Localization**  
   Manages translations and localization for different languages. Supports importing/exporting localization data from files, like Excel or CSV.

8. **Native**  
   Provides platform-specific functionalities for handling native device features such as vibration, GPS, or notifications.

9. **Networking**  
   Manages online features such as multiplayer, leaderboards, and cloud synchronization.

10. **Performance**  
    Optimizes game performance with utilities like Object Pooling, memory management, and framerate monitoring.

11. **Procedure**  
    Manages procedural generation techniques, allowing for the dynamic creation of levels, environments, or other game content.

12. **Resources**  
    Handles resource loading and asset management, optimizing memory usage by managing resource lifecycle efficiently.

13. **Save**  
    Provides a robust system for saving and loading game states, both locally and via cloud storage.

14. **Scene**  
    Manages scene transitions, loading, and unloading of game levels or menus, providing smooth flow between scenes.

15. **Sound**  
    Manages game audio, including background music, sound effects, and environmental sounds. Easily integrate and manage audio using ScriptableObjects.

16. **Timer**  
    Provides a flexible system for managing timers, countdowns, and in-game time-based events. Supports features like pausing, resuming, and looping timers.

17. **UI**  
    Manages user interface components like popups, screens, and HUD elements. Provides functions for dynamic UI transitions and input handling.

### **How to Use**

1. **Drag Prefab to Scene**  
   To initialize the framework in your project, drag the `Main` prefab into your scene.

2. **Create ScriptableObject (SO) Data**  
   - **Screens and Popups**: Create ScriptableObjects to define different screens (e.g., MainMenu, GameOver) and popups (e.g., Settings, Notifications).
   - **Sound and Music**: Create SO for sound effects and music tracks, linking them to corresponding events in your game.

3. **Using the Main Functionality**  
   The `Main` object is the central hub for accessing various systems.  
   - **Object Pooling**: Use `Main.Pool.Create<T>()` to instantiate objects using the pooling system, ensuring optimal performance.
   - **Observer**: Use `Main.Observer.Add("ScoreUpdate", callback)` to subscribe to game events and manage the flow of information between game components.
   
   You can also use `Main.Command`, `Main.Timer`, and other `Main` systems for advanced game management.

This framework provides a structured, reusable foundation for managing various game systems efficiently. The flexibility and modularity of the framework ensure that it can be tailored to different game genres and requirements.
