## **ðŸš€ Quick Start**

### **1. Install Dependencies**
- Required: **Odin Inspector**, **DOTween**  
- Optional: **UIFeel**, **UIParticle**

### **2. Initialize Framework**
1. Go to **Window â†’ OSK-Framework â†’ CreateFramework** to set up the structure.  
2. Use **Create Module** and **Create Config** to enable and configure modules.

### **3. Enable Modules**
- Navigate to **MainModules** and activate the features you need.

### **4. Configure Settings**
- Create ScriptableObjects for resources:
  - Right-click in `Assets` â†’ **Create â†’ OSK** â†’ Select the desired SO type (e.g., **ListMusicSO**, **ListSoundSO**).

### **5. Access Framework**
Use the `Main` object to interact with the systems:
- **Pooling**: `Main.Pool.Spawn<T>()`  
- **UI**: `Main.UI.Open<T>()`  
- **Events**: `Main.Event.Add("EventName", callback)`  
- **Sound**: `Main.Sound.Play()`  
- **Storage**: `Main.Storage.Save<T, U>()`
